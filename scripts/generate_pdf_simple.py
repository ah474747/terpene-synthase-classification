Predicting the specific product of a terpene synthase from its amino acid sequence remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology. Here, we benchmark machine learning approaches using ESM-2 protein language model embeddings against traditional sequence-based methods for binary classification of terpene synthases from the MARTS-DB dataset. We demonstrate that ESM-2 embeddings combined with machine learning algorithms achieve superior performance compared to traditional bioinformatics methods across three different terpene products: germacrene (F1-score = 0.591), pinene (F1-score = 0.663), and myrcene (F1-score = 0.439). Traditional methods consistently underperform, with amino acid composition achieving F1-score = 0.347 for germacrene classification.

    intro_text = """Terpene synthases (TPS) constitute one of the largest and most functionally diverse enzyme families in nature, responsible for the biosynthesis of over 80,000 structurally distinct terpenoid compounds (1). These enzymes catalyze the cyclization of linear isoprenoid precursors into complex cyclic structures, with product specificity determined by subtle variations in active site architecture and reaction mechanism (2). Despite their biological importance, predicting the specific product of a terpene synthase from its amino acid sequence remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology.

Traditional approaches to enzyme function prediction rely on sequence similarity, conserved motifs, and phylogenetic analysis (3). However, these methods often fail for terpene synthases due to their high sequence diversity and the complex relationship between sequence and function (4). Recent advances in protein language models, particularly ESM-2, have shown promise for capturing structural and functional information from amino acid sequences (5). These models learn representations that encode not only sequence patterns but also structural constraints and functional relationships.

Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark comparing machine learning approaches using ESM-2 embeddings against traditional sequence-based methods for binary classification of terpene synthases. We focus on three well-represented terpene products from the MARTS-DB dataset: germacrene (93 sequences, 7.4% class balance), pinene (82 sequences, 6.5% class balance), and myrcene (53 sequences, 4.2% class balance). This multi-product approach allows us to evaluate the robustness of our methods across different terpene chemistries and class imbalances."""

To evaluate the suitability of our models for this practical application, we analyze the performance metrics in the context of sequence ranking and prioritization.

<b>High Ranking Performance (AUC-ROC = 0.931):</b> The germacrene hold-out validation achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.931, indicating exceptional ranking capability. This means there is a 93.1% probability that our model will correctly score a true germacrene synthase higher than a randomly selected non-germacrene synthase. For practical applications, this high AUC-ROC ensures that the most promising sequences will be reliably placed at the top of the ranked list, enabling researchers to focus experimental efforts on the highest-confidence candidates.

<b>Moderate Precision Performance (AUC-PR = 0.580):</b> The AUC-PR of 0.580 reflects the challenge of maintaining high precision across the entire ranking. While this suggests that false positives will increase as one moves down the ranked list, the high AUC-ROC ensures that the very top candidates (e.g., top 12 sequences) will contain a high proportion of true positives.

<b>Practical Strategy for Enzyme Discovery:</b> Our results suggest an optimal strategy for terpene synthase discovery: (1) Use the model to rank thousands of unannotated sequences from databases like UniProt or NCBI, (2) Focus experimental validation efforts on the top-ranked candidates (e.g., top 12 sequences), where the high AUC-ROC ensures the best candidates are prioritized, and (3) Expect some false positives in this top set, but accept this trade-off as typical for "many fish in the sea" discovery problems.

<b>3. Algorithm Selection Matters:</b> Different algorithms excel for different target products, with SVM-RBF performing best for germacrene, KNN for pinene, and XGBoost for myrcene. This suggests that algorithm selection should be product-specific.

With AUC-ROC scores of 0.931 for germacrene classification, our approach enables researchers to efficiently rank thousands of unannotated terpene synthase sequences and focus experimental efforts on the most promising candidates. This transforms the traditional "many fish in the sea" problem into a manageable prioritization task, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel terpene synthases with desired product specificities.

The framework established here can be readily extended to other enzyme families and provides a foundation for future computational enzyme discovery efforts, offering a practical tool for the growing field of synthetic biology and natural product biosynthesis."""
